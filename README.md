# HexConverter

Basic Java Program 
  I created this program as a helper program for while I was in a course called Computer Organization. We did a lot of conversions 
  between hexidecimal and decimal notation. I decided that I wanted to create my own "calculator" for this process. By writing this 
  code, I developed a better understanding of this conversion. It is a very basic java program.
